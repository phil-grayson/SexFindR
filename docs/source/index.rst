SexFindR Workflow Overview
==========================

These pages contain the documentation necessary to run SexFindR on your species of interest. The pages are meant to used in conjunction with the folders on Github (https://github.com/phil-grayson/SexFindR), which contain the same structure. Commands for the analysis of tiger pufferfish (*Takifugu rubripes*) are present throughout to reproduce these analyses as a test case.
