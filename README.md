# SexFindR

This repository contains the basic scripts and configurations necessary to run a sex chromosome identification investigation as outlined in `SexFindR: A computational workflow to identify you and old sex chromsomes` alongside a detailed `Read the Docs` (https://sexfindr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The folder structure in this repo mirrors the page structure in the `Read the Docs` to allow for ease of use.
